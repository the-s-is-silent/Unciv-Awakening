# Unciv-Awakening
Attempts to enhance the lackluster Religion mechanic in Unciv without being (quite) as overpowered as some other mods, but probably doesn't do so that well. Most of the added beliefs are imported from Civ 6, while some weaker beliefs in the base game have been buffed and a few others that are clearly overpowered have been nerfed.
