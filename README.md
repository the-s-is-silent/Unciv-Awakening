# Uncivilized Awakening
Attempts to enhance the lackluster Religion concept without being (quite) as overpowered as some other mods, but probably doesn't do so that well. Most of the current added beliefs along with some of the changes to existing beliefs are imported from Civ 6, while some weaker beliefs in the base game have been buffed and a few others that are clearly overpowered have been nerfed, largely borrowing from two popular mods for the official games, Lekmod and Religion Expanded, for the remaining belief alterations. Also expands the list of available religions to choose from, and might add unique Faith building replacements for the main game civs and some modded civs in the future. Still very much a WIP, one that I don't expect to ever be "finished" until the relevant BNW content is properly implemented in Unciv.

While not required (at least not yet), it is recommended to have the BNW mod enabled when using this mod.

All Religion icons were created by Tomatekh on Civ Fanatics and can be found at [the Civ 5 Customization Wiki's entry on the Tomatekh's Historical Religions mod](https://civilization-v-customisation.fandom.com/wiki/Tomatekh%27s_Historical_Religions), with two exceptions: Voodoo, which was created by Civ Fanatics user Ryoga, and Scientology, which uses [atom](https://thenounproject.com/icon/atom-1081009/) by ProSymbols on [The Noun Project](https://thenounproject.com/). All other icons are from The Noun Project.
