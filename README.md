# Uncivilized Awakening
Attempts to enhance the lackluster Religion concept without being (quite) as overpowered as some other mods, but probably doesn't do so that well. Most of the added beliefs are imported from Civ 6, while some weaker beliefs in the base game have been buffed and a few others that are clearly overpowered have been nerfed, largely borrowing from popular official Civ 5/6 mods Lekmod and Religion Expanded. Still very much a WIP.
