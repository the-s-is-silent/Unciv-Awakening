# Uncivilized Awakening
Attempts to enhance the lackluster Religion concept without being (quite) as overpowered as some other mods, but probably doesn't do so that well. Most of the added beliefs along with some of the changes to existing beliefs are imported from Civ 6, while some weaker beliefs in the base game have been buffed and a few others that are clearly overpowered have been nerfed, largely borrowing from two popular mods for the official games, Lekmod and Religion Expanded, for the remaining belief alterations. Also expands the list of available religions to choose from. Still very much a WIP.

While not required (at least not yet), it is recommended to have the BNW mod enabled when using this mod.

All Religion icons can be found at [the Civ V Customization Wiki's entry on the Tomatek's Historical Religions mod](https://civilization-v-customisation.fandom.com/wiki/Tomatekh%27s_Historical_Religions). All other icons are from The Noun Project.
