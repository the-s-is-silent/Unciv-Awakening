  //TODO: Proper Reformation Beliefs, which I expect to only come in the far future, are needed before this mod can ever be considered to be "finished".
  //A mod option to exclude specific beliefs without making an entire new ruleset is also necessary, because honestly,
  //some of the beliefs in Civ 5 are just so weak that they have no business existing and there isn't much of a point in trying to buff or rework them to make them worthwhile.
  //Implementing Civ 6's separation of Worship Buildings into their own belief type would be nice, but not necessary.
  //And figuring out a few more good Founder and Enhancer beliefs to add would be nice.
  //Also, the typos in the God of Craftsmen pantheon and Divine Inspiration follower belief in the base game annoy me to no end.
  //Current list of beliefs that are meant to be Reformation Beliefs (and some of these might have to be nerfed or removed until Reformation is a thing):
  //Exodus of the Evangelists, Great Awakening, Jesuit Education (which is Reformation in 5 but is a Follower Belief in 6), Monumentality, Puritan Ethics,
  //Religious Fervor (which is also Reformation in 5), Sacred Sites (Reformation in 5, Founder in 6), and Simultaneum.
  //Linga, however, while it follows the model of "ability to buy non-worship buildings with Faith falls under Reformation", it *probably* isn't powerful enough to justify being reassigned to that belief type.
