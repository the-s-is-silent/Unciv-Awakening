  //TODO: Proper Reformation Beliefs, which I expect to only come in the far future, are needed before this mod can ever be considered to be "finished". A mod option to exclude specific beliefs without making an entire new ruleset is also necessary, because honestly, some of the beliefs in Civ 5 are just so weak that they have no business existing and there isn't much of a point in trying to buff or rework them to make them worthwhile. Implementing Civ 6's separation of Worship Buildings into their own belief type would be nice, but not necessary. Also, the typos in the God of Craftsmen pantheon and Divine Inspiration follower belief in the base game annoy me to no end.

  ///////////////////////////////////////// Follower beliefs /////////////////////////////////////////

  //TODO: Beliefs that allow the purchase of non-worship buildings with Faith should be changed into Reformation beliefs once that belief type from BNW is properly implemented. Linga, however, might not be powerful enough to justify being reassigned to Reformation. Great Awakening is meant to be Reformation (Lekmod/Rekmod's equivalent Science-boosting belief Dharma is an Enhancer belief instead but those mods don't respect the purpose of Enhancer beliefs), and the augmented Swords into Ploughshares belief should also become Reformation.
