  //TODO: Proper Reformation Beliefs, which I expect to only come in the far future, are needed before this mod can ever be considered to be "finished". A mod option to exclude specific beliefs without making an entire new ruleset would be nice, because honestly, some of the beliefs in Civ 5 are just so weak that they have no business existing and there isn't much of a point in trying to buff or rework them to make them worthwhile. Simply commenting them out in the Beliefs.json file is a bit more tedious. Implementing Civ 6's separation of Worship Buildings into their own belief type would also be nice, but not necessary. Also, the typos in the God of Craftsmen pantheon and Divine Inspiration follower belief in the base game annoy me to no end. And, yes, the hack on Monument to the Gods makes it worse than actual Civ 5 but is regrettably "necessary" considering it's currently one of the most overpowered beliefs in Unciv due to the lack of proper implementation - I might go the Lekmod route later and make it, along with the two similarly restricted Civ 6 pantheons imported here, last one era longer with a slightly higher boost to compensate.

  ///////////////////////////////////////// Follower beliefs /////////////////////////////////////////

  //TODO: Beliefs that allow the purchase of non-worship buildings with Faith should be changed into Reformation beliefs once that belief type from BNW is properly implemented. Linga, however, might not be quite powerful enough to justify being reassigned to Reformation. Both Great Awakening and the augmented Swords into Ploughshares belief should also be changed into Reformation (Lekmod/Rekmod's equivalent Science-boosting belief Dharma is an Enhancer belief instead but those mods don't respect the purpose of Enhancer beliefs).
